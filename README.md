## Explanation & Design Process

#### This software program is a simulation of a railway management system. It effectively manages all of the administrators, customers, trains, train stations, schedules, tracks, and tickets. Obviously, in its *current* state the application would not be effective in controlling and managing an actual railway system. However, it handles the basics quite well and is **definitely** something that can be built upon. Before I even began a line of code, I wanted to create a project that didn't just fulfill the requirements of the class, but I also wanted to create something that could realistically be implemented. Thus, I've correctly implemented the foundation of the application so far and have rigourously worked to weed out every known bug. I also have implemented safety checks and created a user friendly UI so that someone does not accidently do an action that was unintended.

## How it was Made

#### My Railway Management System was created using JavaFX and its UI along with SQL Server Management Studio.

## Thoughts & Future Plans

#### This project was created with the intent to be a simulation of a railway management system. In its current state, I feel as though this could realistically be implemented as a simplistic application that effectively manages a railway system and all of its components. Obviously, the program still needs to be worked on in order for it to properly function as an actual software program that could control even the most basic railway system.

## Extras & Shameless Self Promotion

#### This is a link to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmQA16swmtPa29pRo9YtRTA?view_as=subscriber), featuring videos of this project on it. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhkxXqMgSw&t=268s) that does "well" at explaining and showcasing the basics of the application and some of its flaws.
