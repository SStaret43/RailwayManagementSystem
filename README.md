# Railway Management System
###### Official CIS245 (Database Management Sys. /SQL) Final Project by [Shane Staret](https://github.com/SStaret43).
###### This is a link to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmQA16swmtPa29pRo9YtRTA?view_as=subscriber), featuring videos of this project on it. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhkxXqMgSw&t=268s) that does "well" at explaining and showcasing the basics of the application and some of its flaws.

## Explanation & Design Process

#### This software program is a simulation of a railway management system. It effectively manages all of the basic things that a railway system must have: administrators, customers, trains, train stations, schedules, tracks, and tickets. Obviously, in its *current* state the application would not be effective in controlling and managing an actual railway system. However, it handles the basics quite well and is **definitely** something that can be built upon. Before I even began a line of code, I wanted to create a project that didn't just fulfill the requirements of the class, but I also wanted to create something that could realistically be implemented. Thus, I've correctly implemented the foundation of the application so far and have rigourously worked to weed out every known bug. I also have implemented safety checks and created a user friendly UI so that someone does not accidently do an action that was unintended.

#### The most important step in this whole process was actually designing the UI and creating pseudocode before even opening up the IDE to write code. To have an effective railway management system, there are some obvious things that are needed. First, I decided that there were going to be two "classes" of sorts: users and objects. The main idea was that the users I implemented would be able to interact with the objects. From there, I further split up the users into "administrators" and "customers" and created five objects: tickets, trains, train stations, schedules, and tracks. Essentially, administrators could do *everything* (except delete other admins of course) and customers could purchase tickets. So, from the getgo, I realized that customers would have to limited access, whereas admins would have to have complete access. Therefore, two separate views would have to be created to account for the different areas I wanted each user to manipulate. Of course, there would also need to be a login screen to verify a user and there would also have to be a "create account" screen so that new users could join. So, I went about designing these four separate scenes by actually drawing them and thinking about what I would want to see as a user. After designing the frontend, I came up with the most efficient way to organize the backend. The total number of "things" I had was seven--two users and five objects. Obviously, that means within the database there would be at least seven tables and multiple relationships between these users and objects. At this moment, I asked myself, "*What is the main object that this program is built around?*" ...Well considering its a railway management system, obviously the answer is the train...right? Well at first that is what I thought, but I quickly realized that it is actually the ticket.

## How it was Made

#### My Railway Management System was created using JavaFX and its UI along with SQL Server Management Studio.

## Thoughts & Future Plans

#### This project was created with the intent to be a simulation of a railway management system. In its current state, I feel as though this could realistically be implemented as a simplistic application that effectively manages a railway system and all of its components. Obviously, the program still needs to be worked on in order for it to properly function as an actual software program that could control even the most basic railway system.
